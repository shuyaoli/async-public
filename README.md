Folder _cpp_ is used to store testing .cpp files.

_main\_*.m_ with "MATLAB" in "*" is implemented with MATLAB.

_main\_*.m_ with "mex" in "*" is implemented with mex and C++.

All files ending with "direct" means the implementation is straightforward from Finito paper without further optimization, i.e. different from the one in the textbook.
